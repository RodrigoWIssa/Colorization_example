## Colorization
Simple example of multi-objective network training. Similar to to Let there be Color! by Iizuka et al.: http://iizuka.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/projects/colorization/data/colorization_sig2016.pdf
The implementation is done in the notebook with some examples for visualization. The chkpt file contains the model checkpoint.
